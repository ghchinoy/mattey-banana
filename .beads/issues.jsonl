{"id":"morphlab-compat-svgs","title":"Optimize SVG Export for Generative AI Animation (MorphLab Compat)","status":"open","author":"ghchinoy","body":"Mattey Banana is currently the perfect tool for converting PNG/JPEG silhouettes into highly precise linear coordinates (`L` commands) for physical plotters and CNC machines like the Fletcher-Terry F-6100.\n\nHowever, we are now utilizing Mattey Banana outputs as the source SVGs for an AI animation tool called **MorphLab**.\n\nMorphLab uses Gemini to intelligently animate standard SVGs. When we feed it Mattey Banana current linear SVG outputs, the AI times out or hits its output token limit because the `L` coordinate data creates files that are massive (60KB - 100KB) and incredibly dense.\n\n### Requirements for Web/AI-Friendly SVGs\nWe need to build a distinct output mode specifically designed for web and AI consumption.\n\n1. **Bézier Spline Curve Fitting**: Instead of relying solely on `path[i].0, path[i].1` straight lines in the `export_to_svg` Rust function, we need to utilize `visioncortex` capability to generate smooth Cubic Bézier Curves (`C` commands). This will drastically reduce vertex counts, dropping file sizes from 90KB down to ~5KB without losing visual fidelity.\n2. **Semantic Path Islands**: Currently, `export_to_svg` loops through all discovered paths and concatenates them into a *single* `<path>` element with `fill-rule=\"evenodd\"`. We need the option to emit distinct `<path>` elements for distinct, non-overlapping geometric islands. (This allows the AI to target specific parts of the drawing, like animating an arm independently of a head).\n3. **Opt-in Only**: The core goal of Mattey Banana is still to drive physical hardware with raw polylines. This new AI-friendly Bézier/Semantic SVG export should be triggered via a distinct flag or UI toggle (e.g. \"Web/Animation Optimized (Splines)\" vs \"CNC Optimized (Polylines)\").\n\n### Technical Starting Point\nLook at `wasm/src/lib.rs`. \n- Focus on `trace_to_json()` and `export_to_svg()`.\n- You may need to change what `trace_to_json` serializes (currently just vectors of points) to include spline control points if `is_spline` is set to true.\n\nUpdate the Lit frontend (`frontend/src/`) to expose a setting to let the user choose which SVG variant they want downloaded.","created_at":"2026-02-22T13:35:00Z","updated_at":"2026-02-22T13:35:00Z"}
