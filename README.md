# 🍌 Mattey Banana

**AI to Vector Generator**

Mattey Banana is a specialized web application designed to bridge the gap between generative AI and physical craftsmanship. It converts AI-generated imagery into clean, optimized vector paths (SVG/DXF), specifically tuned for legacy CNC hardware like the Fletcher-Terry F-6100 matte cutter.

*From AI Prompt to Vector Outline*

## 🚀 Features

-   **Vector-Ready AI Prompts:** Integrated Prompt Assistant helps users craft high-contrast, zero-noise imagery perfect for tracing.
-   **Rust-Powered WASM Engine:** High-performance `vtracer` (visioncortex) engine providing high-fidelity tracing with support for both polygons and Bézier splines.
-   **Contour Hierarchy:** Advanced path discovery that correctly identifies and handles internal holes and nested shapes.
-   **Path Simplification & Denoising:** Adjustable noise filtering ("turd" removal) and path smoothing to ensure clean, efficient vectors.
-   **CNC Optimized:** Generates `LwPolyline` DXF files with manageable vertex counts, ideal for legacy Windows 98-era plotters like the Fletcher-Terry F-6100.
-   **Real-time Preview:** Adjust threshold, noise, and smoothing settings with instant visual feedback.
-   **Dual Format Export:** Download designs as high-fidelity **SVG** (with splines) or optimized **DXF** (flattened polylines).

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js & npm
-   Rust & `wasm-bindgen-cli`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
2.  **Build the WASM module:**
    ```bash
    cd wasm
    cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
    wasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/matte_wasm.wasm --out-dir ../frontend/src/wasm --target web
    ```
3.  **Run the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Configure API Key:**
    Open the application in your browser and enter your Gemini API key in the **AI Assistant** tab. It will be securely stored in your browser's IndexedDB.

## 🌐 Deployment

This project is configured for **GitHub Pages**. Any push to the `main` branch will trigger a GitHub Action that:
1.  Compiles the Rust WASM module in `--release` mode.
2.  Packages the Lit frontend.
3.  Deploys the optimized assets to the project's GitHub Pages site.

## 🎨 Example Pipeline

| Stage | Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. AI Generation** | A high-contrast PNG silhouette of a Monstera leaf. |
| **2. WASM Tracing** | Rust engine scans pixels and discovers closed-loop contours. |
| **3. Final Vector** | An optimized DXF/SVG ready for the matte cutter. |

## 📝 Roadmap

-   [ ] **Advanced Scaling:** User-defined DPI and physical dimension settings (inches/mm) for precise CNC cutting.
-   [ ] **DXF Bézier Support:** Investigate support for true `SPLINE` entities in DXF exports for modern plotters.
-   [ ] **Batch Processing:** Support for tracing and exporting multiple generated images at once.
